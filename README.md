The frontend for the Quiz App is built using Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the backend API. The frontend allows users to sign up, sign in, view available quizzes, create new quiz, and play any quiz of their choice. The use of Next.js allows for fast rendering of the pages, while Tailwind provides a sleek and modern design. TypeScript is used for type checking and to ensure that the code is less prone to errors.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
